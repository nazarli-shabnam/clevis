# Self-hosting

This is the infrastructure/ops guide — getting the Clevis stack itself running and configured. For how to sign in and connect a GitHub org once the instance is up, see the [README](../README.md#get-started).

## Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose

## Setup

1. Clone the repo and copy the env template:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nazarli-shabnam/clevis
   cd clevis
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in `.env`. Seven vars are hard-required (the app fails to start without them) — `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `JOB_SECRET_KEY` (`openssl rand -hex 32`), `AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`), `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` (`openssl rand -hex 32` — auths the `redis` service used for webhook ingestion, issue #191). Everything else in `.env.example` has a safe default and only needs overriding per environment (e.g. `CORS_ORIGINS` for your real UI domain, `GITHUB_API_BASE` for GitHub Enterprise).

3. Register a GitHub App on github.com (**Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**) so users can connect their orgs after the instance is running. The App form asks for three separate URLs — each one is where GitHub sends the browser back to at a different point in the flow, so don't reuse one URL for another's purpose:
   - **Homepage URL** — your deployed UI URL. Shown on the App's public listing page; not used in any redirect.
   - **Callback URL** — `<NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE>/auth/github/callback`. GitHub redirects here after a user clicks "Sign in with GitHub" and approves the login. Must match this exact path, or sign-in fails.
   - **Setup URL** (under "Post installation") — `<NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_BASE>/settings/github-callback`, with **"Redirect on update"** also checked. GitHub redirects here after a user clicks "Install GitHub App" on the Settings page and finishes installing the App on an org. Setting this URL is what lets Clevis learn the installation happened: on that redirect, the UI records a new `github_installations` row for the org. If the Setup URL field is left blank, GitHub instead redirects to the Homepage URL above — Clevis never sees that callback, so the org never gets connected, and the app silently behaves as if nothing was installed at all (no error, just a permanently empty org).
   - **Webhook** — optional, but recommended: set the webhook URL to `<NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE>/webhooks/github`, generate a webhook secret in the same form, and copy that secret into `.env` as `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Without a webhook configured, Clevis has no way to find out when a user uninstalls the App on GitHub's side, so that org's `github_installations` row is never cleaned up — it just goes stale in the database.
   - **Webhook events** — subscribe to `Dependabot alert`, `Code scanning alert`, and `Secret scanning alert`, and grant the matching read-only permissions (**Dependabot alerts**, **Code scanning alerts**, **Secret scanning alerts**) under "Permissions & events". Without these, `POST /webhooks/github` never receives `dependabot_alert`/`code_scanning_alert`/`secret_scanning_alert` deliveries at all — GitHub only sends events an App is both permitted to read and subscribed to, silently, with no error on either side. These feed the Security dashboard's per-repo alert data — `apps/worker/src/event_consumer.py` normalizes them into `security_alerts` (post-S6 PR 2).
   - Also subscribe to `Member` and `Organization` — these need only the **Members** organization permission set to **Read-only**. Feeds the Collaborators dashboard's org-membership/repo-access data — normalized into `org_members`/`repo_collaborators` (post-S6 Collaborators PR 1). Don't subscribe to `Membership`/`Team`: `POST /webhooks/github` doesn't ingest them (issue #411 — team-based repo access has no normalizer yet, and ingesting with nothing to consume them just accumulated unbounded rows), so GitHub deliveries for them would only add noise with nothing on the Clevis side reading it.
   - Also subscribe to `Push`, `Pull request`, `Issues`, `Release`, and `Create` (needs the **Contents**, **Pull requests**, **Issues**, and **Metadata** repository permissions at **Read-only**). `apps/worker/src/event_consumer.py` normalizes these into `repo_events`, which powers the Activity Feed and the commit heatmap / Overview aggregates. Without them the Activity Feed still works but falls back to a rate-limited live GitHub read (only the last ~30 org events, no history), and the heatmap/aggregates stay sparse — they're only otherwise seeded by the one-time install-time backfill, which ages out.
   - Grant read access to the repository/organization data the security checks need (contents, metadata, administration, members).
   - **Optional — Actions-minutes usage card (issue #294):** to show the Overview page's "Actions Usage" card, grant the App the organization **Administration** permission at **Read-only** (this is what gates `GET /organizations/{org}/settings/billing/usage/summary`, the enhanced-billing usage API — the older `/settings/billing/actions` endpoint it used to call was retired by GitHub on 2025-09-26). Billing data was an explicitly deferred roadmap area; without this permission the card just doesn't render (the API returns a 400 and the query fails silently). No write access is needed.
   - **Optional — "File as issue" (issue #286):** to let admins open a GitHub issue straight from a failed Security check, grant the **Issues** repository permission **Read and write**. Without it the button is still shown, but the create call returns a 403 that the UI surfaces as a "needs Issues: write" hint.
   - **Optional — "Fix this" auto-remediation (issue #287):** to let admins enable a failing security setting in one click from the Security page, grant **Administration** repository permission **Read and write** (branch protection, secret scanning) and **Dependabot alerts** **Read and write**. `Fix this` currently covers: enable secret scanning, enable Dependabot alerts, and apply branch protection to the default branch — the last of which also resolves the "default branch allows force pushes" check. When the branch has *no* protection yet, Clevis applies a conservative default: require 1 PR review, block force-pushes and deletion, no required status checks, and `enforce_admins` **off** (so a repo admin keeps an emergency-merge path — tighten this yourself if you want admins bound too). When the branch is *already* protected, Clevis keeps every existing rule and only turns force-pushes off; if the existing rules include push restrictions it can't safely reconstruct, the fix returns a 409 and asks you to make the change manually. Org 2FA enforcement and code-scanning-alert dismissal are intentionally not automated. Existing installs must re-approve after the permissions are added; without them each fix returns a 400 pointing back here.
   - **Optional — Stale-PR nudges (issue #289):** to let admins nudge open pull requests that have sat without review past a threshold — a one-line comment (idempotent) or a `needs-review` label — grant the **Pull requests** repository permission **Read and write**. The threshold and mode are set in Settings → Instance Configuration: `pr_nudge_stale_days` (default 3) and `pr_nudge_mode` (`off` / `comment` / `label`, default `comment`). Without the permission the "Nudge stale PRs" button on the Pull Requests page returns a 400 pointing here. On-demand only — a periodic background sweep is a separate follow-up.
   - **Optional — Bulk branch-protection apply (issue #288):** to let an org admin apply a branch-protection preset to many repos at once from the Automation page, grant the **Administration** repository permission **Read and write** (same permission "Fix this" uses). The Automation → Branch protection card runs a dry-run diff first, then applies. The preset controls four knobs (required approvals, enforce-on-admins, block force-push, block deletion); every other rule a branch already has — required status checks, code-owner reviews, linear history, etc. — is preserved, and the diff shows exactly what would change. A branch whose protection restricts *who* can push is reported as an error and left untouched. Applied presets can be saved per repo (`automation_repo_settings`). Without the permission every repo comes back 403 and the call returns a 400 pointing here.
   - **Optional — Workflow policy lint + auto-fix PR (issue #291):** the Automation page's "Lint workflows" button scans a repo's `.github/workflows/*.yml` for a `pull_request_target` trigger that checks out untrusted PR code (and for attacker-controlled text interpolated into `run:` scripts). Scanning is read-only and needs no extra permission. **"Open fix PR"** — which flips `pull_request_target` to `pull_request` when the workflow uses no secrets — needs the **Contents**, **Pull requests**, *and* **Workflows** repository permissions at **Read and write** (GitHub blocks pushing `.github/workflows/**` changes without the last). Org-admin only; without the scopes it returns a 400 pointing back here.
   - **Optional — Workflow dispatch (Automation page):** to let an org admin trigger GitHub Actions workflows from the Automation page — one workflow, or "Dispatch all" for every active workflow in the repo — grant the **Actions** repository permission at **Read and write**. Listing workflows and run history needs only **Actions: Read**; the `POST .../dispatches` call (single or bulk) needs **Read and write**, otherwise GitHub returns `403 Resource not accessible by integration` and the Automation page shows a "Workflow dispatch" entry in the "N automations need extra GitHub access" notice. On the legacy PAT fallback, a classic token needs the `repo` scope.
   - **Optional — Dependabot auto-triage (issue #290):** the Automation page can approve (and, if you opt in, merge) low-risk Dependabot PRs. Grant the **Pull requests** repository permission **Read and write** (to approve); for `approve_and_merge` mode also grant **Contents** **Read and write** (to merge). **It's disabled per repo by default** — enable it per repo in the Automation page and pick a mode. `approve_only` (the default) only approves; only `approve_and_merge` merges, and "Run for real" is a two-step confirm. A PR is acted on only when *all* hold: the author is `dependabot[bot]`, the bump is patch-level (parsed from the PR body; unparseable → skipped), every check on the head commit is a completed success, and there's no pending or requested-changes human review. There's a per-run cap (5), a dry-run preview, and every decision — acted on or skipped, with the reason — is written to the audit log. Without the permissions the run returns a 400 pointing back here.
   - **Private key** — this is a separate secret from the webhook secret above; GitHub doesn't ask for it on the creation form. After the App is created, open its settings page, scroll to the **"Private keys"** section (near the bottom, under "General"), and click **"Generate a private key"**. This downloads a `<something>.pem` file — open it and copy the *entire* contents, including the `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` / `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` lines, into `.env` as `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
   - Copy the remaining values into `.env`: `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` (all shown on the same settings page, near the top). Also set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_APP_SLUG` to the App's slug (found in its public page URL) — the UI uses this slug to build the "Install GitHub App" button's link.

   **If your GitHub App was registered before the Setup URL field above was documented here:** open the App's settings on github.com, go to the "Post installation" section, and add the Setup URL now. Orgs that already completed installation don't need to reinstall — only new installs and updates will use the new callback page going forward.

   **Connecting more than one account/org:** there's no limit — install the App from the sidebar menu (labeled "Connect account" before you've connected anything, "Switch account" once you have) or the Settings → Connected GitHub accounts button, as many times as you need. Connecting an organization requires you to be a GitHub **owner** of it (Clevis live-checks this against GitHub); if you're only a member, ask an owner to connect it.

   **After the App's permissions are widened:** when a new Clevis release adds an optional write automation (issues #286–#291), existing installations keep working but the new feature stays blocked until a GitHub org owner re-approves the App's updated permission request. Clevis shows affected org admins a "N automations need extra GitHub access" notice in Settings and on the Automation page with a "Review on GitHub" link; the notice clears automatically once the owner approves (via the `installation` `new_permissions_accepted` webhook).

4. (Optional) Configure SMTP so self-registered accounts can verify their email: set `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT` (default `587`), `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM` in `.env`. Without these, registration still works — accounts are created immediately — but they stay unverified and can't accept an org invitation until either SMTP is configured and the user clicks the emailed link, or they link a GitHub account instead (GitHub-verified emails are trusted immediately). Accounts created via first-run `/auth/setup` or "Sign in with GitHub" are always verified, regardless of SMTP.

5. (Optional) Give the worker its own Postgres credential, separate from the API's `DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD`: set `WORKER_DB_PASSWORD` in `.env`. Row-Level Security (issue #190, migrations 0030/0031/0033/0046) has already landed — setting this switches the worker's live database connection to the dedicated `clevis_worker` role instead of sharing `DB_USER`, so it's actually subject to RLS rather than bypassing it as a superuser. The worker keeps working exactly as before if left unset. It only takes effect via the `db` container's first-ever startup (`docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` scripts only run once, against a fresh, empty data volume). If you're setting this on an **existing** deployment (a `db` volume that's already initialized), run this once by hand instead:

   ```bash
   # 1. docker compose up -d db recreates the db container so it picks up
   #    WORKER_DB_PASSWORD from .env, then re-runs the same init script the
   #    fresh-volume path uses (safe to re-run; it's a no-op if the role
   #    already exists) — this avoids retyping the password into a raw SQL
   #    literal and avoids relying on host-shell vars .env doesn't export.
   docker compose up -d db
   docker compose exec db sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/01-create-worker-role.sh

   # 2. Grant it the table privileges migration 0020 would otherwise apply.
   #    Runs inside the db container so it uses the container's own
   #    POSTGRES_USER/POSTGRES_DB, not unexported host-shell variables.
   docker compose exec db sh -c 'psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c "GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON jobs TO clevis_worker; GRANT SELECT ON app_config TO clevis_worker; GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON repo_events TO clevis_worker; GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON repo_events_id_seq TO clevis_worker; GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON webhook_deliveries TO clevis_worker;" -c "DO \$do\$ BEGIN IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = '"'"'public'"'"' AND tablename = '"'"'repo_event_daily_counts'"'"') THEN GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON repo_event_daily_counts TO clevis_worker; END IF; IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = '"'"'public'"'"' AND tablename = '"'"'activity_sync_cursors'"'"') THEN GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON activity_sync_cursors TO clevis_worker; END IF; IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = '"'"'public'"'"' AND tablename = '"'"'security_alerts'"'"') THEN GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON security_alerts TO clevis_worker; GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON security_alerts_id_seq TO clevis_worker; END IF; IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = '"'"'public'"'"' AND tablename = '"'"'org_members'"'"') THEN GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON org_members TO clevis_worker; GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON org_members_id_seq TO clevis_worker; END IF; IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = '"'"'public'"'"' AND tablename = '"'"'repo_collaborators'"'"') THEN GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON repo_collaborators TO clevis_worker; GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON repo_collaborators_id_seq TO clevis_worker; END IF; IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = '"'"'public'"'"' AND tablename = '"'"'org_membership_sync_cursors'"'"') THEN GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON org_membership_sync_cursors TO clevis_worker; END IF; END \$do\$;"'
   ```

   The `repo_event_daily_counts`, `activity_sync_cursors`, `security_alerts`, `org_members`, `repo_collaborators`, and `org_membership_sync_cursors` grants are guarded by existence (unlike the others on this line): this step can run before step 7 below has ever applied Alembic migrations on an update to an existing deployment, and an unconditional `GRANT` on a table that doesn't exist yet would fail outright (CodeRabbit finding on #341) — the other grants here predate this guard and are left as-is, not retroactively changed, to keep this fix scoped to what #341 actually added.

   Don't rely on re-running `alembic upgrade head` for step 2 — if migrations `0020`/`0036`/`0037`/`0038`/`0039`/`0040`/`0041` already applied (as a no-op, since the role didn't exist yet), Alembic considers them done and won't re-run them. Restart the `worker` container afterward to pick up the new credential.

6. (Recommended) Give the API its own non-superuser Postgres credential, separate from `DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD`: set `API_DB_PASSWORD` in `.env`. Without this, the API connects as `DB_USER` — the `initdb` bootstrap superuser — which unconditionally bypasses Row-Level Security regardless of `ENABLE`/`FORCE` (issue #330). **This is the only thing that makes RLS enforce anything.** As of issue #412, every tenant-scoped table has `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` set (not just `ENABLE`) — but `FORCE` only stops a table's *owner* from bypassing RLS, and in the default deployment the owner is exactly this same bootstrap superuser, which bypasses regardless of `FORCE` anyway. Set both this and step 5's `WORKER_DB_PASSWORD` if you want RLS to be real defense-in-depth rather than a no-op; if you leave both unset, tenant isolation rests **entirely** on the application-level `WHERE tenant_id = :t` checks in every query, same as before #412. Same fresh-volume-only caveat as the worker's credential above. If you're setting this on an **existing** deployment, run `docker/provision-api-role-existing-deployment.sh` instead of the fresh-volume init script:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db
   docker compose cp docker/provision-api-role-existing-deployment.sh db:/tmp/provision-api-role.sh
   docker compose exec db sh /tmp/provision-api-role.sh
   ```

   Unlike the worker (which only ever needs `SELECT`/`UPDATE` on `jobs` and `SELECT` on `app_config`), the API needs schema `USAGE`, table privileges on every table, and sequence privileges for every serial primary key — this script creates the role and applies all three grant kinds in a single `psql` invocation wrapped in one transaction, so an operator never ends up with a role that has `CONNECT` but no table/schema/sequence privileges (which a failure partway through two separate commands could otherwise leave behind). It's deliberately not placed under `docker/postgres-init/` — that directory auto-runs on every fresh volume, at a point before Alembic has created any tables yet, so its `GRANT ... ON users, orgs, ...` statements would fail on a genuinely fresh volume. Safe to re-run. Restart the `api` container afterwards to pick up the new credential.

7. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

   Or, on a tagged release, pull the pre-built images instead of building from source:

   ```
   ghcr.io/<owner>/clevis-api
   ghcr.io/<owner>/clevis-worker
   ghcr.io/<owner>/clevis-ui
   ```

8. Verify it's up:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/healthz   # -> {"status": "ok"}
   ```

   Then open the UI and continue with the [Get started](../README.md#get-started) flow in the README.

## Leadership digest (optional, issue #292)

Clevis can email each org's admins a periodic summary (security score movement, current
open risk items, recent push activity). It is **off by default** and uses only data
Clevis already stores — no additional GitHub App permission.

- Requires SMTP (the same `SMTP_*` block as email verification above).
- Enable it in **Settings → Instance Configuration → Leadership Digest** (`weekly` or
  `monthly`), or set the `digest_cadence` app-config key directly.
- `digest_poll_seconds` (default `3600`, clamped `[300, 86400]`) controls how often the
  API's background sweep checks whether a digest is due; a tenant is emailed at most once
  per cadence interval, tracked via a `digest.sent` audit-log entry.

## Security notes

- **Row-Level Security is opt-in, not on by default.** Every tenant-scoped table has RLS policies with `FORCE` set, but in the default deployment both the API and worker connect as the Postgres bootstrap superuser (`DB_USER`), which bypasses RLS unconditionally. Tenant isolation in a default deployment is enforced **entirely at the application layer** — every query is expected to filter by `tenant_id`, and that's the only thing standing between one tenant's data and another's. Set `API_DB_PASSWORD` (step 6) and `WORKER_DB_PASSWORD` (step 5) if you want RLS to actually enforce isolation as a second, independent layer.
- Sign-in uses a JWT held in an httpOnly session cookie, not a trusted request header — set `session_cookie_secure=false` only for local HTTP dev, never in production.
- Restrict API ingress behind your reverse proxy/SSO; the base `docker-compose.yml` deliberately publishes no host ports (Traefik-only) for this reason.
- Prefer GitHub App auth over the legacy personal-access-token path for anything beyond local testing — tokens are Fernet-encrypted at rest either way, but App installation tokens are short-lived and scoped per-org.

## Observability

- The API has request-ID-tagged logs and a health endpoint at `/healthz`.
- The worker logs each job's outcome (done/failed) as it processes the queue.
