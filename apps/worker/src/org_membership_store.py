"""org_members + repo_collaborators write path (Collaborators PR 1 of 3).

Both tables represent current state, not a log -- upserted on add/edit, deleted on remove --
unlike repo_events_store's insert-and-skip shape. Mirrors security_alerts_store.py's separation
from event_consumer.py.

Ordering: GitHub doesn't guarantee webhook delivery order, and this consumer's own reclaim path
(event_consumer.py's _sweep_pending) can retry a crashed-then-recovered delivery well after a
later delivery for the same login/repo already processed successfully -- so an "add" and a
"remove" for the same key can be applied out of order. Every write here is guarded by the
event's own received_at (the same ingestion-time signal repo_events uses for occurred_at) against
the stored row's added_at/granted_at: an upsert only applies if it isn't older than what's
already stored (CodeRabbit finding on Collaborators PR 1), and a removal only applies if the
event that caused it isn't older than the row's last write -- so a stale "removed" can't delete a
grant a newer "added" already re-established, and a stale "added" can't resurrect/overwrite a
newer "removed". Residual gap, accepted rather than solved here: a "removed" that's processed
*before* a still-older "added" for a login with no existing row at all has nothing to compare
against (the row doesn't exist yet) and will still be clobbered by that late-arriving stale
"added" -- closing that fully would need a tombstone (remembering removed logins even after
deletion), not just a comparison against a row that no longer exists. Narrow window, not
addressed in this PR.

    on conflict so it doesn't clobber a correction this very function already made), this
    treats every field the poll saw as authoritative: `role` and `avatar_url` are always
    overwritten, since this poll IS the reconciliation for exactly the staleness
    upsert_org_member's own docstring describes. `two_factor_enabled` uses COALESCE instead of
    a blind overwrite -- the poll's 2FA overlay call is best-effort (see
    membership_reconcile.py's fetch_org_roster) and a caller passes None for it when that
    single call failed this cycle; COALESCE preserves a previously-known value instead of
    losing it to one transient failure.

    Also removes any existing org_members row for this tenant whose login the poll did NOT
    see -- a real departure the removal webhook missed (delivery lost, or arrived while this
    tenant had no App installation to receive it). This is the actual reconciliation: the
    webhook path alone can drift (this migration 0040's own docstring), and this poll is what
    corrects it, not just fills gaps.

    `added_at` is preserved for a login the poll already had a row for (its real
    webhook-sourced join time); for a login the poll discovers with no existing row (a missed
    member_added), added_at is set to `synced_at` -- the poll has no way to know the true join
    time, and "first seen by reconciliation" is a better lower-bound guess than leaving it
    unset. An empty `members` list is treated as a no-op, not "remove everyone" -- GitHub
    always has at least one org owner, so an empty roster from a real API call would be a bug
