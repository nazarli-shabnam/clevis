"""Security compliance matrix and secret-scanning alerts (docs/plan.md Phase 16).

The org-wide `analytics.overview` scan already computes org-level pass/fail check
results (see `checks.runner.run_all_checks`) -- this router instead breaks the same
dimensions down per-repo, which is what an admin needs to act on a specific finding.
It re-derives each dimension directly from the GitHub API per repo rather than reusing
`checks.github_checks`, since those check classes are written to aggregate across all
repos into a single org-wide pass/fail, not to return a per-repo row.

Personal-scoped (`/me/...`), matching `analytics.py`'s `/me/analytics/overview` --
the Security page scans an arbitrary owner by name, not necessarily a workspace Org
the caller has an `OrgMembership` row for, so there's no `require_org_role` path
gating this route directly. Token resolution still prefers an org-scoped installation
over a personal one when `owner` does match an Org the caller is a member of, via
`resolve_owner_token` -- see its docstring for why that's still membership-gated.
