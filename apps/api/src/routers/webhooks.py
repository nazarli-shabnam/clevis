# Events API `type` strings, hence "create" not "CreateEvent"):
#   - Activity Feed events (push/pull_request/issues/release/create) -- normalized by
#     S4's event-processor fleet into repo_events/repo_event_daily_counts.
#   - Security alert events (dependabot_alert/code_scanning_alert/secret_scanning_alert,
#     added for the Security dashboard's per-repo compliance matrix + alerts panel,
#     issue #191-follow-on) -- normalized into security_alerts as of post-S6 PR 2.
#     Requires the Clevis GitHub App's own webhook subscriptions + permissions
#     (Dependabot alerts: read, Code scanning alerts: read, Secret scanning alerts:
#     read) to be turned on for GitHub to actually send these -- see
#     docs/self-hosting.md.
#   - Org membership / repo access events (member/organization, added for the
#     Collaborators dashboard, post-S6 stage) -- normalized into
#     org_members/repo_collaborators (see event_consumer.py). Requires the Clevis
#     GitHub App's own webhook subscriptions + permissions (Members: read -- no write
#     or Administration access needed) -- see docs/self-hosting.md.
# Either way, an ingested event just accumulates in webhook_deliveries with
# status="queued" until its consumer exists -- that's the expected handoff state, not
# a bug.
#
# membership/team are deliberately NOT subscribed here (issue #411): team-based repo
# access normalization doesn't exist yet (see event_consumer.py's
# _NOT_YET_NORMALIZED_EVENT_TYPES / org_membership_store.py's module docstring), and
# ingesting them anyway had no bound -- webhook_deliveries rows and Redis stream
# entries accumulated forever with no consumer ever moving them past "queued". Re-add

# the consumer group's XREADGROUP won't see it anymore); webhook_requeue_sweep.py's
# staleness check now also catches a row trimmed before consumption (still 'queued' well
