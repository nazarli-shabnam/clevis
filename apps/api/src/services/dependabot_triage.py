"""Auto-triage low-risk Dependabot PRs.

High-risk (approving/merging is hard to undo), so every safety rail is on by default:
per-repo opt-in (default disabled), ``mode`` defaults to ``approve_only``, and a PR is
only acted on when all of: author is dependabot[bot], not draft, patch-level bump only,
all checks green, and no pending/requested human review. Capped per-run (default 5);
every decision is audit-logged by the router.

Requires ``pull_requests: write`` (approve) + ``contents: write`` (merge); a 403 becomes
a 400 pointing at docs/self-hosting.md.
