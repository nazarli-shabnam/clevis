"""S5 PR 2: periodically re-sync tenants whose activity_sync_cursors row has gone stale.

Reuses PR #342's install-time backfill job type (github.backfill_repo_events) unchanged --
gap-healing is that same job, triggered on a schedule instead of only at install time.

Issue #410: also covers tenants with a connected installation but *no* cursor row at all --
that means the install-time backfill (best-effort, per PR #342's
_enqueue_backfill_best_effort) never even got a job queued, or the job never completed, and
there's no other retry mechanism for that first backfill. Treated as maximally stale, sourced
from the installation row itself (see _installation_account) since there's no cursor payload
to read account_login/account_type from.

Called from an asyncio background loop started in main.py's lifespan (see gap_heal_loop.py),
mirroring apps/worker's own poll-loop shape rather than pulling in a new scheduler dependency.
