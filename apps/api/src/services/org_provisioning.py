"""
Auto-provisions and reconciles Clevis org memberships from verified GitHub org status.

Runs at OAuth login time, where a live user token is transiently available (see
src/routers/github_auth.py). Fetches the user's org memberships (role included) from
GitHub in a single call, then does two things:

1. For every org where they're currently a GitHub admin, get-or-creates the Clevis Org
   and grants/refreshes an admin OrgMembership for them. This covers both "first person
   to connect this org" and "another verified GitHub admin signing in later" — GitHub
   already vouches for admins, so no invite is required.
2. Reconciles every *existing* Clevis OrgMembership for this user against the freshly
   fetched GitHub state: demotes to "member" if GitHub now says member, and deletes the
   row entirely if GitHub no longer lists the org for this user at all (removed or the
   org went private to them). This prevents privilege escalated via GitHub admin status
   from outliving its GitHub grant — Clevis previously only ever created/no-op'd
   memberships and never revoked them.

Non-admin GitHub members who have no prior Clevis membership are never auto-added here;
they only gain access through the explicit invite-accept flow.

Best-effort: any GitHub API failure is logged and swallowed so it never blocks login (and
existing memberships are left untouched rather than being wiped on a transient failure).
