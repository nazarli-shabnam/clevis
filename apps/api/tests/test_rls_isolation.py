"""End-to-end proof that RLS (migrations 0030/0031) actually blocks cross-tenant access
under the real, non-superuser clevis_api role -- not just against a hand-built throwaway
test role. This is the concrete claim issue #190's closing comment promised and, before
this test existed, had only ever been checked by hand (see docs/self-hosting.md and the
migration 0032/0033 verification notes) rather than as a standing regression test.

Deliberately does NOT use the shared `db` fixture (conftest.py) -- that fixture is bound
to whatever settings.database_url the rest of the suite runs under, which is the
bootstrap superuser DB_USER in most local/dev runs (superuser unconditionally bypasses
RLS, so this test would silently prove nothing if it ran that way). Instead this test
opens its own connection explicitly as clevis_api: reused as-is when the suite is already
running under clevis_api (CI's python job, after issue #330's verification wiring), or
built by swapping credentials onto the same host/port/db when a local run sets
API_DB_PASSWORD to opt in. Skips (not fails) when neither is true, so a plain local
`pytest -q` run without API_DB_PASSWORD configured still passes -- that's the documented,
optional "Recommended" setup per AGENTS.md, not a hard requirement.

audit_logs is used as the RLS-protected table under test: it gets the simple strict
tenant_isolation equality policy (migration 0030), with none of memberships'/
github_installations' widened self-access carve-out (migration 0031) that would
complicate a minimal two-tenant isolation check.
